Simple Wordle game that users guess a three letter word. If the user has a letter in the correct spot a "O" would appear on that spot. If the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot it will show a "+". If it is wrong then a "X" will appear. Once the user guess the correct answer then the answer will appear in the bottom of the screen.
